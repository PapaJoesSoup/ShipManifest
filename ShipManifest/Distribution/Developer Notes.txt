ShipManifest API
-------------------------------------------------
Ship Manifest supports other Mods via exposing certain elements of the mod as public to the outside world.  
Developers can use the enclosed SMWrapper.cs class in their projects to easily integrate with SM.
SMWrapper uses reflection to derive the needed objects, properties, & methods for accessing SM's Crew Transfer Features.

Thanks go out to JPLRepo for writing SMWrapper.cs, and helping with testing and refactoring.
-------------------------------------------------


Using SMWrapper.cs
-------------------------------------------------
Add SMWrapper.cs to your solution and change the namespace at the top of the file to your own.

Add calls to obtain an SMAddon instance in the Start or Awake event handlers of your mod.
Use the exposed objects as needed.

DeepFreeze, by JPLRepo implements SMWrapper, so you may examine his Git Repository for details on advanced implementation.
-------------------------------------------------


Under the hood
-------------------------------------------------
SM uses an SMAddon Instance for basic API connectivity and instantiation.  
It is available at all times and contains a flag to notify you of transfers in progress. 
Inside this instance is an instance of the TransferCrew class that encapsulates all info needed for in progress Crew Transfers.  
TransferCrew objects are only available in Flight.

This section will expand as I have time to add.

Thanks for considering integrating with SM!
