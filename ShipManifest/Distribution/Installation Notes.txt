Thanks for downloading Ship Manifest!

Ship Manifest is a tool to manage your ship's "things".  I started with Crew Manifest (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60936) as a basis for this work, with great thanks to vXSovereignXv for creating Crew Manifest, and Sarbian for contributions to Crew Manifest.

I've now re-imagined it into Ship Manifest, using the same easy to navigate visual system that vXSovereignXv used.  SM has since been expanded and refactored to the point that it is now a completely original work.


NOTE:  SM has no dependencies on other mods.  If installed, Ship manifest is designed specifically to take advantage of:
	- Blizzy's Toolbar. http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863.
	- Connected Living Space (Verson 1.1.1.0 or higher)  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70161.
	- Module Manager  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219
	- DeepFreeze  (Version 0.16.0.2 or higher)  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124720
	- RemoteTech Antennas  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305
	- KSP-AVC  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745
	- CKAN  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067

 - Kottabos did a fine review here:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_TNxjnW234 (Feb 28th 2014). It was very educational for me :).  I've long since fixed the bugs and added so much more... :D
